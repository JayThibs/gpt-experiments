# GPT Experiments

This repository contains various experiments and prototypes to get use to working with GPT-like models and being creative with them.

## Overview

### Experiments in notebooks

1. [Simple Text Generation with GPT-Neo using Huggingface](https://github.com/JayThibs/gpt-experiments/blob/main/notebooks/gpt_neo_simple_text_generation.ipynb)

Here I just followed [this tutorial](https://github.com/mallorbc/GPTNeo_notebook) to get an understanding of how to use EleutherAI's GPT models with Huggingface and test different prompts to get a feel for the model's capabilities.
