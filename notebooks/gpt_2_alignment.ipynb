              "'<|endoftext|> I\\'ll be running an Ask Me Anything on this post from Friday (April 30) to Saturday (May 1).\\nIf you want to ask something just post a top-level comment; I\\'ll spend at least a day answering questions.\\nYou can find some background about me here.\\n<|endoftext|>**I—Meanings**\\nNow that we have some more concrete thinking under our belt, it\\'s time to circle back on Goodhart\\'s law for value learners. What sorts of bad behavior are we imagining from future value-learning AI? What makes those behaviors plausible, and what makes them bad?\\nLet\\'s start with that last point first. Judgments of goodness or badness get contextualized by models, so our framing of Goodhart\\'s law depends on what models of humans we tolerate. When I say \"I like dancing,\" this is a different use of the word \\'like,\\' backed by a different model of myself, than when I say \"I like tasting sugar.\" The model that comes to mind for dancing treats it as one of the chunks of my day, like \"playing computer games\" or \"taking the bus.\" I can know what state I\\'m in (the inference function of the model) based on seeing and hearing short scenes. Meanwhile, my model that has the taste of sugar in it has states like \"feeling sandpaper\" or \"stretching my back.\" States are more like short-term sensations, and the described world is tightly focused on my body and the things touching it.\\nOther models work too! That\\'s fine, there\\'s plenty to go around.The meta-model that talks about me having preferences in both of these models is the framing of competent preferences. If someone or something is observing humans, it looks for human preferences by seeing what the preferences are in \"agent-shaped\" models that are powerful for their size.\\n(At least, up to some finite amount of shuffling that\\'s like a choice of prior or universal Turing machine. Also note that the details of the definition of \"agent-shaped\" matter—we\\'ll come back to this under the umbrella meta-preferences.)\\nSo when we call certain behavior \"bad,\" the usage of that word might carry with it the implication of what way of thinking about the world that judgment is situated in, like how \"I like dancing\" makes sense when situated in a model of chunks of my day. There\\'s not one True Model in which the True Meaning of the word \"bad\" is expressed, though there can still be regularities among the different notions of badness.\\n**II—Mergers**\\nWhat were the patterns that stood out from my previous discussions of what humans think of as bad behavior in value learning?\\nThe most common type of failure, especially in modern day AI, is when humans are actively wrong about what\\'s going to happen. They have something specific in mind when designing an AI, like training a boat to win the race, but then they run it and don\\'t get what they wanted. The boat crashes and is on fire. We could make the boat racing game more of a value learning problem by training on human demonstrations rather than the score, and crashing and being on fire would *still *be bad behavior.\\nFor simple systems where humans are good at understanding the state space and picturing what they want, this is the only standard you need, but for more complicated systems (e.g. our galaxy) humans can only understand small parts or simple properties of the whole system, and we apply our preferences to those parts we can understand. From the inside, it can be hard to feel the distinction! We want things about tic-tac-toe or about the galaxy with the same set of emotions. What makes deciding what to do with the galaxy different is that we have these scattered preferences about different parts and patterns, and the different parts don\\'t stay neatly separate from each other. They can interact or overlap in ways that bring our preferences into conflict.\\nThis is a key point. Inter-preference conflicts aren\\'t an issue that ever comes up if you think of humans as having a utility function, but they\\'re almost *unavoidable *if you think of humans as a physical systems with different possible models. The nail in the coffin is that we humans can\\'t fit the whole galaxy into our heads, nor could evolution fit it into our genes, and so out of necessity we have to use simple heuristics that work well pragmatically but don\\'t fit together perfectly. If humans don\\'t resolve their preference conflicts well, this can lead to bad behavior like thinking the grass is always greener on the other side of the decision tree.\\nBad preference aggregation can also lead to new-ish bad behavior on the part of a value learner. This bad behavior can look like encountering a situation where humans are conflicted or inconsistent, and then resolving that conflict using a method <|endoftext|>'"
